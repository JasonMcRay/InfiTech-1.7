### Issue Reporting
When reporting issues make sure to:
* Provide the best description of problem you are having (include Screenshots if you want)
* Provide crash report file if you crashed (use pastebin.com)
* Have FML log ready if that will be needed
* Don't report crafting issues to mod developers. Report them in here, since I am the one changing recipes. So any recipe problems (crafting and unification) report to ME!

### Pull Requests
Just make sure they work :)

### Important for using dev configs
I made these configs available for public so you can tinker with them. WARNING! I hold no responsibility if it will break something in your world!

Also note that sometimes there is not only config files update, but sometimes the mods are updated as well, which means that develeopment configs will not work properly if you also don't update required mod. I will try to remember to note it in commit description.
