In the vanilla ingredients, they only occur when you try to add an effect without first adding netherwart (or add a second effect ingredient without using netherwart in between). Note that 8192 means, to the vanilla brewing system 'can make a splash potion without losing it's effects', and a potion with a value of EXACTLY 8192 does not have any effects anyway.
