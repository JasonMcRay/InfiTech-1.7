WARNING: There will be around 50 missing items from update 3.1.14 to this one. Reason is that Forestry changed the IDs of its Wooden Logs (to be more specific, they use now just 1 ID with different NBT tags).
It will probably cause those Wooden Logs and other wood related items (logs, planks, slabs, fences) gone from your worlds. There is nothing you can do about that.

Multiblocks (alvearies or farms for example) will lose their inventories and may need to be broken and rebuilt.
